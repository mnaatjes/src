# packages/shared-library/experiments/

This directory contains experimental code, deprecated code, and other items that are not currently in active use or are under development.

**Purpose:**

* **Isolate experimental code:** To keep experimental features, prototypes, and proof-of-concept code separate from the main, actively maintained codebase.
* **Archive deprecated code:** To store deprecated code for future reference or potential reuse.
* **Organize temporary code:** To provide a dedicated space for temporary code snippets or unfinished projects.

**Contents:**

* **Experimental features:** Code for features that are still under development or not yet ready for production use.
* **Deprecated code:** Code that is no longer actively used or maintained, but might be useful for reference or potential future use.
* **Proof-of-concept implementations:** Experimental code that demonstrates the feasibility of a particular approach or technology.
* **Temporary code snippets:** Small code snippets or helper functions that may be useful in the future.

**Note:**

* This directory is intended for temporary or experimental code. 
* Regularly review the contents of this directory and remove any items that are no longer needed or relevant.
* Consider using a more specific subdirectory name if needed (e.g., `experiments/feature-x`, `experiments/deprecated-components`).
